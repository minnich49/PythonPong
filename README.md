Python-Pong-Game
================

This is a simple game that uses Python to create a Pong-Style game that also uses Lasers to attack and hit the ball

Use Left and Right arrows for Player One - Use up arrow to fire lasers.
Use A and D for Player Two to move left and right - Use S to fire lasers downward

Scores are shown wihtin the Pygame window.

Test data is there just to show the laser traveling as I was debugging.
